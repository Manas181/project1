Before running this code, make sure you have a Twilio account set up and the twilio Python library installed on your Raspberry Pi. You'll also need to replace the account_sid, auth_token, twilio_number, and recipient_number variables with your own information.

Note that you can customize the message content and formatting however you'd like. Additionally, there are other services and libraries you could use to send notifications from a Raspberry Pi, depending on your specific needs and preferences.
